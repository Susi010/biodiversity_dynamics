# Explorative data analysis

## Abundance over the years

Stacked barplot showing cumulative abundance of the 13 selected bird taxa for each each year, while showing individual species contribution represented by different colors.

-   Y-axis: number of sampled individuals

-   Highest total abundance in 2000 and 2021: more than 950 and 1050 individuals

-   Main abundance contribution: Rohrammer, Bartmeise, Teichrohrsänger, Schilfrohrsänger

-   Abundance decline between 2006 and 2018 with less than 450 Individuals in 2010 & 2012

-   Main decline in Schilfrohrsänger, also Teichrohrsänger, Bartmeise, Rohrammer

![](images/ggplot_sp_yr.png)

Box plot (1st row) and bar plot with mean and standard deviation of sampled individuals per year (2nd row) for each taxa showing spread and variation of abundance per year

-   Largest mean and variation of sampled individuals per year for Rohrammer, Bartmeise, Teichrohrsänger and Schilfrohrsänger

-   With Bartmeise and Teichrohrsänger showing greatest variation around the mean

-   Pronounced standard deviation in Feldsperling attributable to few (2) outliers

+-----------------------------------------------------------+

Bar plot for each taxa showing number of individuals for each year, while showing male/female composition

-   Fitis, Rohrschwirl, Gartengrasmücke and Schilfrohrsänger have lower abundances during 2005 and 2018

-   Drosselrohrsänger abundance higher during 2005 and 2014

-   Bartmeise and Blaumeise have pronounced abundance decline in 2010/11; abundance appears somewhat opposed to each other:

    -   2000 to 2004: high abundance of Bartmeise vs. low abundance of Blaumeise

    -   2021 to 2023: low abundance of Bartmeise vs. high abundance of Blaumeise

-   Amsel and Weißsterniges Blaukehlchen have main abundance in the last 8 to 9 years of the sampling period (2014 to 2023)

-   Feldsperling has main abundance in the first 9 years of the sampling period (2000 to 2009)

-   Large occurrence of unknown sex in Fitis, Rohrschwirl, Feldsperling, Gartengrasmücke and Blaumeise -\> needs to be considered for parameter estimation with sex as co-variate

# Statistical analysis

Cormack-Jolly-Seber model for open capture-recapture analysis -\> estimates of detection and survival probability in open population where size changes over time due to death, (permanent) emigration

Assumptions:

-   Animals randomly sampled

-   Equal capture probabilities for all animals at each sampling event

-   No loss of marks

-   Homogeneity of capture and survival probabilities

## Constant survival and detection probability: Basic model

Estimates of survival (Phi) and detection (p) probability for each taxa from the CJS-model assuming constant survival and detection probability.

-   MLE for survival probability mostly larger than detection probability

    -   Phi ≈ 40 - 70%, p ≈ 10 - 30%

-   Except for Feldsperling, Blaumeise, Bartmeise, Rohrschwirl, and Fitis -\> mostly smaller and lighter birds

    -   Phi ≈ 20 - 40%, p ≈ 40 - 70% for Blaumeise, Bartmeise, Rohrschwirl

    -   Phi and p similar ≈ 25 - 30% for Feldsperling

    -   Phi ≈ 15 - 20%, p ≈ 25 - 30% for Fitis but large confidence interval around p

![](images/ggplot_est_basic.png)

## Varying survival and detection probability

estimates for phi and p varying over time and varying on various co-variates:

-   Time interval

-   Sex (male, female, unknown)

-   "Observer" -\> different samplers over entire sampling period might contribute to different detection probabilities due to different effort

-   Temperature

### **Fitis / Willow Warbler** (*Phylloscopus trochilus)*

#### AIC values of six best models

Sex (= "Geschlecht") seems best to model parameter estimates, as the first five models with the lowest AIC have one or both parameters, but mainly survival probability, estimated based on sex. Estimation for detection probability varies between no co-variate, sex, observer and even time. All five models are better than the basic model with constant probability for "Phi" and "p".

```{r}
head(AIC_Fitis[order(AIC_Fitis$AIC),2:6])
```

#### Parameter estimates for best model: Phi.sex_p.dot

-   Phi: male = 21,5%, female and unknown \< 5% (left plot, 1st row)

-   p = 40% (left plot, 2nd row)

-   Differences in survival estimate between male and female statistically not necessarily significant, as confidence interval of survival estimate of male sex within confidence interval of female sex

-   Differences in survival estimate between male and unknown sex statistically likely, as estimate of male sex outside of confidence interval of unknown sex

-   Plotting number of sampled individuals of each sex against number of recapture (right plot) shows approx. 40% of individuals captured only one time is of unknown sex, while sex is either male or female when recaptured a second time, and only male when recaptured a third time

=\> caution with survival estimates, due to large amount of unknown sex in the data set

+------------------------------------+----------------------------------+

### **Gartengrasmücke / Garden Warbler** (Sylvia borin)

#### AIC values of six best models

-   First eight models with lowest AIC and better than basic model

-   For phi temperature or no co-variate best, otherwise sex or time interval

-   For p no co-variate or temperature best, otherwise also time interval

```{r}
AIC_Gartengrasmücke[order(AIC_Gartengrasmücke$AIC),2:6]
```

#### Parameter estimates for best model: Phi.temp_p.dot

-   p = 31% (1st plot, 2nd row) detection probability higher than detection probability in basic model (p = 15%)

-   Phi (1st plot, 1st row): several probability peaks for survival for temperatures of around 9°, between 13° - 17°, and at 19°C

-   Problem of statistical significance due to wide confidence interval around survival estimates

-   Survival peaks in model align more or less with higher numbers of sampled individuals at those temperatures (2nd plot) -\> several peaks between 12° and 19°C

=\> Caution with survival estimates, due to cut off of capture data, as temperature starts only in 2004

### **Schilfrohrsänger / Sedge Warbler** (*Acrocephalus schoenobaenus*)

#### AIC values of six best models

-   Almost all models better than basic model

-   For phi no co-variate or temperature best, otherwise sex or time interval

-   For p temperature or no co-variate best, otherwise also sex or time interval

```{r}
AIC_Schilfrohrsänger[order(AIC_Schilfrohrsänger$AIC),2:6]
```

#### Parameter estimates for best model: Phi.dot_p.temp

-   Phi = 44% (1st plot, 1st row) survival probability higher than survival probability in basic model (Phi = 37%)

-   p (1st plot, 2nd row): difficult to see clear trend in detection probability for temperature -\> possibly due to overfitting

-   Problem of statistical significance due to wide confidence interval around detection estimates

-   Trend in detection probability between 15° - 20°C in model mirrors increasing numbers of sampled individuals for temperatures closer to 20°C (2nd plot)

=\> Caution with detection estimates, due to cut off of capture data, as temperature starts only in 2004

```

#### Parameter estimates for best model: Phi.temp_p.dot

-   p = 25% (1st plot, 2nd row) detection probability higher than detection probability in basic model (p = 16%)

-   Phi (1st plot, 1st row): several probability peaks for survival for temperatures between 8° - 11°, 12° - 13°, 16° - 20°, and at 22°C

-   Survival peaks in model mirror higher numbers of sampled individuals at those temperatures (2nd plot) -\> similar hill shape in both plots between 16° and 20°C

=\> Caution with survival estimates: neglect of capture data before 2004 and wide confidence interval around estimates

    -   Slightly declining trend in survival probability after 2013, otherwise no trend recognizable

    -   Large confidence interval around estimates -\> statistical significance questionable

-   Wide distribution with several peaks in number of sampled individuals over entire sampling period (2nd plot)

    -   Between 2011 and 2017 individuals captured up to three times

### **Rohrammer / Reed Bunting** (*Emberiza schoeniclus)*

#### AIC values of six best models

-   Almost all models better than basic model

-   For phi no co-variate or temperature best, otherwise sex or time interval

-   For p temperature or no co-variate best, otherwise observer

```{r}
AIC_Rohrammer[order(AIC_Rohrammer$AIC),2:6]
```

#### Parameter estimates for best model: Phi.dot_p.temp

-   Phi = 49% (1st plot, 1st row) -\> survival probability higher than in basic model (Phi = 43%)

-   p (1st plot, 2nd row): no clear trend and high variation in detection probability for temperature -\> over fitting?

-   Wide distribution with several peaks in number of sampled individuals over entire temperature range (2nd plot)

=\> Caution with detection estimates: neglect of capture data before 2004 and wide confidence interval around estimates

# Summary

-   Abundance trends of

    -   Schilfrohrsänger, Teichrohrsänger, Bartmeise, Rohrammer: decline during 2006 and 2018

    -   Weißsterniges Blaukehlchen, Amsel: increase in second half of sampling period

    -   Feldsperling: decline over entire sampling period

```{=html}

```
-   Basic model

    -   Survival probability higher than detection probability for most bird taxa, which mostly larger and heavier

    -   Survival probability lower than detection probability for 5 bird taxa -\> mainly smaller and lighter

        -   Fitis, Rohrschwirl, Bartmeise, Blaumeise, Feldsperling

-   Main co-variates for differences in survival and detection probability:

    -   Sex:

        -   Male higher survival probability than female in Amsel, Goldammer;

        -   Problemtic with large proportion of unknown sex, like Fitis and Blaumeise

    -   Even time interval:

        -   Differences in survival probability for each sampling occasion align with abundance distribution only for Amsel

        -   Rather complex model with little explanantory value for Blaumeise and Goldammer

        -   Suggestion to include effect of uneven time interval

    -   Observer:

        -   Different detection probability depended on observer only for Weißsterniges Blaukehlchen

        -   Suggestion to include effect of observer on detection probability for all taxa, not just one taxa individually

    -   Temperature:

        -   most complex model which mostly leads to over fitting and thus little explanatory value especially for Schilfrohrsänger, Teichrohrsänger, Rohrschwirl, Bartmeise, Feldsperling

-   Other co-variates necessary to explain abundance trends: humidity, weight, life span?
